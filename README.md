This repository contains the [report](https://github.com/yijing-sie/Multimodal-Data-and-Causal-Representation-Learning/blob/main/Multimodal%20Data%20and%20Causal%20Representation%20Learning.pdf) that was motivated by Dr. Kun Zhang'research project about the causal representation of multimodal data when I was his research assistant as an intern.
